This is a mini bird shooting game made with CvZone & Pygame. The webcam detects the
hand and measures the distance between the index and the mid finger. 
You can shoot at a bird which is randomly flying through game screen just by bringing
them closer. This project can be used as a base to create different hand-detection 
projects. Enjoy!
